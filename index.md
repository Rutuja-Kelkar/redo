Two months after I started working on [digi_info](https://rutuja-kelkar.github.io/digi_info/) four of my other curious friends and me decided to team up & end to end video production services for college professors/ tutors to facililate their online classes during pandemic.

I insisted to take up sale since I was already in the loop of giving presentations and figuring marketing tactics due to [digi_info](https://rutuja-kelkar.github.io/digi_info/). At that point sales seemed an interesting opportunity. So during this period I visited almost 30+ schools and colleges in belgaum (my native in karanataka, India) to pitch our idea. We managed to wire in 6 professors and got them on board. We shooted their videos, edited them their bundled videos.

## An insulting pitch experience 
I fondly remember one insulting pitch from a known dental college in belgaum.

So we went to this dental college and requested for a meeting with the princiapl. The principal was unavailable so we were asked to meet the HOD, head of department, she was a lady professor. We carrie laptop, pamplate and sample video's + potch video's that we were to present. The peon was kind enough to show us the way to HOD's cabin.We went inside and explained why we were here. On hearing this, she immediately busted on me na dmy friend (we were 2 of us) shouting at us and saying "Who sent you ?, where are you from, we don't entertain such non-sense stuff, our college is not for people like you" etc etc 

We were dressed really smart and looked professional, but this HOD mam, had no slightest audacity to even listen to our oitch and insulted us in front of five of her other colleagues. She busted on us as if we had commited a serious crime.But later, one of her colleague adviced her to take a look at our pitch. We immediately presented, swollowed our prides, wished their college good luck and headed our way out.

That day I realised, not everyone perceives the way you persive yourself plus I started finding better ways to reach out to people.

## Best sales method I found so far

The best method I found so far is to do it gracefully ! On the first pitch call never sell, instead understand the pain points of the other party, be geneuine friends with them, ultimately sales involves people and when people are involved a lot of things can go wrong. But if you play this game well, it can turn you into a proft making machiene.

In todays's world "sales" and "coding / building" are the only two things that can grow you and your money in a compounded rather exponential way.

## Are direct pitches bad ?
I've observed o lot of people making direct pitches, which is good in some cases, but wort in otehr cases. Sales is all about listening carefully to people, creating a word of mouth network and then introducing your product / services as a value add asset to them.Marketing helps largely in touch points, but marketing might not always give you correct data. On the 1st pitch your always validating the match of marketing data you collected  about a prospect and accordingly adjusting your negotiation deal. It's acctually fun if you do it the way !

Anyway, we got an opportunity to meet the top educators/ professors / principals in the city and head on understood the level of questions + rejections we need to be prepared for.

During redo I did not have in depth info about sales, but we managed to get in few professors who paid us. Today I have few frameworks and sales processess ready to roll and saved for future use.
